High heterogeneity of malignant cells highlighted the need to systematically identify and characterize intrinsic consensus cell states across patients. We developed an intrinsic consensus cell states recognition method and identified Normal Epithelial Function (NEF), Immune, Cellcycle, and Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT)) states from 11,467 malignant cells in 29 lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), which were validated by two additional single cell datasets. These states exhibited distinct transcriptional and functional features which regulated by state-specific key transcription factors. Cellcycle and EMT states showed stronger signal sending strengths and their specific interaction strength was significantly associated with poor prognosis. Single-cell, bulk and spatial transcriptomic analyses all revealed NEF states dominated early-stage LUAD while Cellcycle and EMT states in advanced stages. NEF state gradually branched into Cellcycle and EMT states along transition trajectory regulated by key transcription factors. Multiple bulk datasets showed the role of Cellcycle and EMT states in poor prognosis. This study analyzed intrinsic consistency among cancer patients amidst the complex intra- and inter-tumor heterogeneity, aiding in more comprehensive diagnosis and treatment.
